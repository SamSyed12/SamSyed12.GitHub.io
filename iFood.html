										<h1>iFood: What's Working and What Isn't ?</h1>
									</header>
									<p>Considering it's position as the lead food delivery app in Brazil, with presence in over a thousand cities nationwide, 
										maintaining customer engagement is key for both growth and consolidating it's position as the as the market leader. 
										The company provided a sample <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackdaoud/marketing-data">dataset</a> that mocks metainformation 
										on customers demographics and campaign interactions whilst also providing company data. I aimed to understand this data and conducted a robust exploratory 
										analysis in the hopes of finding business opportunities & insights together with data driven proposals that could optimize the campaigns results & 
										generate value for the company. After the removal of duplicate information and imputing outliers/missing data by the 
										mean the dataset consisted of 2205 customers. In total 37 different data attributes were provided in the dataset and included the following types of 
										information:
									</p>
									<p><b>Customer Demographics | Customer Product and Channel Preferences | Customer Campaign Acceptance/Rejection | Company Metrics</b></p>
									<h4><u>Some Key Takeaways</u>
									</h4>
									<p> -   <b>72%</b> of customers <em>rejected</em> all campaigns. <br>
										-   Customer's with <b>no children</b> and customers with <b>high income</b> spend more and are more <em>responsive to campaigns</em>. <br>
										-	Campaign acceptance and expenditure is <b>lower</b> in those who <em>earn less</em> and those who <em> kids</em>. <br>
										-	<b>Wine</b> and <b>Meat</b> drive iFood’s revenue; making up <b>83%</b> of total revenue. <br>
										-	<b>Web</b> and <b>In store</b> purchases are most popular among consumers, these channels account for <b>67%</b> of all sales. <br>
										-	<em>Campaign 6</em> was most successful (attracted <b>15%</b> of the consumer base), <em>Campaign 2</em> the least (<b>1%</b> success rate). <br> 
										-   Customer's who were responsive to <em>Campaign 5</em>spent the most with an average of <b>$1536</b> per customer. <br>
										- 	The average iFood customer spends around <b>$563</b> (with <em>$306</em> attributed to Wine and <em>$166</em> to Meat). <br>

										</div>
										<p>- Customers who earn more are spending more on iFood products <b>[68% of expenditure variance is explained by income]</b> <br>
										   - Revenue is largely driven by sales of wine and meat <b>[83% of iFood revenue is generate via these products]</b></p>

										<p>A bivariate analysis suggests that as customer income rises so does the average amount spent by the customer. Based on this, 
										customers were segmented by income into four groups and their spending habits were investigated. The majority of iFood’s customer 
										income levels are concentrated within the $25000 - $75000 range with this making up 73% of customers.

										</div>
										<p>- Those who earn more than <em>$50000</em> make up <b>89%</b> of IFood's income while <b>39%</b> of this is solely attributed to those making more than <em>$75000</em> a year</p>
									</div>
									<div class = "row">
										<div class="col-4 col-12-small">
											<br>
											<p>Although <em>48% of IFood’s customers make less than $50000 a year, these customers are only responsible for 11% on the income</em> generated by iFood 
												over the previous two years. Thus, most of iFood’s revenue is being driven by customer’s earning more than $50000. Notably customers who 
												earned more than <em>$75000 only made up 16% of iFood’s customer base yet are responsible for 39% of revenue</em> generated. This makes sense upon 
												consideration that wine and meat sales drive iFood’s revenue, which like money spent, are also positively correlated with income 
												<b>(R = 0.72, R= 0.70)</b>. Thus, iFood revenue seems to be significantly driven by the purchasing of wine and meat by higher income customers.

										</div>
										<p>A similar pattern to that seen in the spending habits of high income customers is witnessed in customers with no children 
											(however this group does also tend to earn more). These customers tend to <em>spend more</em>,
											once again particularly on wine and meat, and they are also <em>more receptive to iFood's
											 campaigns</em>. Although these customers only make up <b>28%</b> of the iFood customer base they constitute <b>53%</b> of its revenue and <b>46%</b> of the 
											 customers that accepted campaigns. Contrastingly, customers who have children are earning less and are less likely to 
											 accept campaigns. Notably, these effects are more pronounced in those who have kids in contrast to customers who 
											 only have teens.
										</p>
										<p>It is noteworthy that those with at least one child still <em>spend a greater percentage of their total purchases on wine</em>, 
											with <b>62%</b> of revenue generated in that customer segment attributed to wine sales in comparison to 47% in those who do 
											not have children. Moreover, this segment of customers made </em>4.4 times more web-visits (<b>82%</b> of all web-visits) in 
											comparison to those with children</em> and prefers making purchases through deal offers (<b>86%</b> of all deal purchases). 
											However, the increased web-activity of this segment <em>does not translate to an increase in web purchases</em>, with an average 
											of <b>0.66</b> purchases per visit in comparison to an average of <b>1.28</b> purchases per visit seen in those with no children.

										<p>iFood sells its products through four main channels, via deals, in-store, online, and catalogue. Most purchases were made In store 
										<b>(39%)</b>, yet a sizable portion can be attributed to web purchases as well <b>(28%)</b>. In contrast purchases made via deals or catalogue 
											were far less common among customers. Notably, an increased number of web visits per month did not seem to correlate with an 
											increase in web purchases <b>(R= -0.06)</b>.

										</div>
										<p>Overall, only <b>28%</b> of iFood’s customer base accepted at least one campaign, with the <em>average campaign attracting <b>11%</b> 
											of customers</em>. Among these, campaign 6 was the most successful, and attracted 254% more customers (311 in total) 
											than the campaign average prior to it, which was 122. Campaign 2 proved to be the least successful with an acceptance 
											rate of <b>1%</b>. As discussed earlier, campaign acceptance is positively correlated with income and a lack of children and 
											is negatively correlated with having children. Moreover, those who accept one campaign are more likely to accept 
											another, with <b>39%</b> <em>of campaign acceptance stemming from customers who had already accepted one campaign prior</em>. 
											Campaign 5 acceptance was positively correlated with customer expenditure, with an average spend of <b>$1536</b>.

									<h3 id="iFoodSect5"><u>The Future</u></h3>
									
									<p>- Higher income groups and customers with no children are driving expenditure on iFood products together with campaign acceptance, in contrast having 
										children is negatively correlated to both money spent and campaign success. Thus, a two-pronged advertising approach is suitable.
										<br>
										<br>

										- - The first should target <em>high income groups without children</em>:
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>Personalized Campaigns</b>: Develop personalized marketing campaigns highlighting premium products like wine and meat. Use targeted emails and social media 
										ads that showcase these products' quality and exclusivity.
										<br>
										<b>Exclusive Deals and Membership Programs</b>: Introduce exclusive deals and membership benefits such as priority delivery or special discounts on premium items.
										<br>
										<b>Content Marketing</b>: Create content around wine and gourmet food pairing, recipes, and lifestyle blogs that resonate with high-income customers.
										<br>
										<br>
										
										- - The second should focus on <em>low-income groups with children</em>:
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>Affordable Meal Plans and Deals</b>: Offer budget-friendly meal plans and deals that are family-oriented. Emphasize value for money, and convenience.
										<br>
										<b>Partnerships with Schools and Family-Oriented Brands</b>: Collaborate with schools, childcare centers, and family-oriented brands to offer promotions 
										and educational content about healthy eating for families.
										<br>
										<b>Seasonal Campaigns and Promotions</b>: Run seasonal campaigns during school holidays, back-to-school periods, and festive seasons that cater to 
										families with children.
										<br>
										<br>
										
										-	Wine and Meat are the most successful products, generating 83% of total iFood sales, sales of less popular products need to be increased.
										<br>   
										<br>
										<b>Bundling and Cross-Selling</b>: Create bundles that include popular items (like wine and meat) with less popular products to encourage customers to 
										try new items.
										<br>
										<b>Discounts and Flash Sales</b>: Run flash sales and discounts on less popular products. Highlight these offers on the main page of the app and website.
										<br>
										Customer Reviews and Testimonials: Encourage customers to leave reviews and testimonials for less popular products to build trust and interest 
										among potential buyers.
										<br>
										<br>
										
										-	Web and store purchases are the most successful channels; thus, advertising should take place and focus on these channels in order to increase customer engagement:
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>Enhanced Web Experience</b>: Improve the web experience with an intuitive interface, faster load times, and personalized recommendations based on browsing 
										history and previous purchases.
										<br>
										<b>In-Store Promotions</b>: Use in-store displays, flyers, and promotions to drive attention to ongoing campaigns and less popular products. Employ QR codes 
										 that customers can scan to learn more about products and offers.
										 <br>
										<b>Omni-Channel Strategy</b>: Ensure a seamless experience across all channels. For instance, allow customers to view and use their in-store loyalty points and 
										rewards online.
										<br>
										<br>
										
										-	Campaign 6 was the most successful, Campaign 2 the least, and Campaign 5 acceptance was positively correlated with iFood revenue:
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>Campaign Analysis</b>: Conduct a detailed analysis of Campaigns 2, 5, and 6 to understand what worked well. Identify key elements such as the type of offers, 
										communication channels used, and customer demographics targeted.
										<br>
										<b>Replicate Success Factors</b>: Apply the successful strategies identified from these campaigns to future campaigns. Customize the approach based on the target
										 audience for each campaign.
										 <br>
										<b>A/B Testing</b>: Implement A/B testing for campaign elements like subject lines, visuals, call-to-actions, and offers to continuously optimize campaign 
										performance.  
										<br>
										<br>
										-	Website visits per month are negatively correlated with website purchases. iFood should Investigate customer behavior on website and attempt to 
										increase customer website visit to purchase ratio:
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>Behavioral Analytics</b>: Use tools like Google Analytics and heatmaps to understand user behavior on the website. Identify drop-off points, popular pages, 
										and areas for improvement.
										<br>
										<b>Personalized Recommendations</b>: Implement AI-driven personalized recommendations based on browsing and purchase history to increase the website 
										visit-to-purchase ratio.
										<br>
										<b>Streamlined Checkout Process</b>: Simplify the checkout process to reduce cart abandonment. Offer multiple payment options and ensure the process is mobile-friendly.
										<br>
										<br>
										
										<h4 id="iFoodSect5"><u>General Recommendations:</u></h4>
										<b> - Loyalty Programs</b>:
										<br>
										Introduce a robust loyalty program that rewards customers for frequent purchases, referrals, and engagement with campaigns. Offer points that can be redeemed 
										for discounts or exclusive products.
										<br>
										<br>
										<b> - Innovative Payment Solutions</b>:
										<br>
										Offer flexible payment solutions such as Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) and subscription models for regular deliveries of essential items.
										<br>
										<br>
										<b> - Sustainability Initiatives</b>:
										<br>
										Promote sustainable practices by offering eco-friendly packaging, and sourcing products from sustainable suppliers. Highlight these efforts in marketing campaigns 
										to attract environmentally conscious customers, who tend to be higher income, have the ability to spend more, and make up the majority of iFood revenue.
